                "text": "Contrary to popular belief, the color of your car has no impact on your insurance premiums. Factors that actually affect your premiums include your driving record, age, gender, and the type of car you drive."

                "heading": "Myth #2: You need to change your oil every 3,000 miles",
                "text": "While this used to be true, modern cars can often go between 7,500 and 10,000 miles before an oil change is necessary. Consult your owner's manual to determine the recommended mileage."

                "heading": "Myth #3: Premium gas is better for your car",
                "text": "Unless your car specifically requires premium gas, using it instead of regular will not provide any additional benefits. In fact, it could actually harm your car and waste money in the process."

                "text": "While all-wheel drive can provide better traction in certain conditions, it is not always necessary or advantageous. Front-wheel drive can offer better fuel economy and lower overall cost."
