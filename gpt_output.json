                "heading": "Step 1: Choose the right materials",
                "text": "Select materials that are light-weight and durable. For example, fibreglass or carbon fibre for the body, aluminium or steel for the frame."
            },

                "heading": "Step 2: Design the body",
                "text": "The body of the hovercraft should be aerodynamically designed so that it glides over the air cushion, reducing the resistance. To achieve this, ensure that the body has a streamlined shape and is low-slung."

            {
                "heading": "Step 3: Build the Air Cushion",
                "text": "The air cushion is made by a fan that blows air into the cavity underneath the hovercraft. This cavity should be lined with a skirt made of airtight material that allows the cushion to be contained."

                "heading": "Step 4: Install the Motor",
                "text": "As the hovercraft will be propelled by electric motors, it’s important to use a high-quality motor that is designed to withstand the harsh environment. The motor should be secured to the frame with adequate vibration damping."
            },
            {
                "heading": "Step 5: Install Control System",
                "text": "The hovercraft is controlled with a rudder, which directs the air flow from the fan. The rudder is attached to servo motors that control the direction and magnitude of the air flow."
            },

                "heading": "Step 6: Install Batteries and Speed Controllers",
                "text": "Electric hovercraft requires batteries, and speed controllers to control the power to the motor. Ensure that batteries and speed controllers are of high quality and are compatible with the motor."

                "heading": "Step 7: Testing and Fine-tuning",
                "text": "Once the hovercraft is complete, you need to test and fine-tune it to ensure that it performs optimally. This may involve adjusting the rudder, measuring the speed and adjusting the motor and battery settings."

                "heading": "Step 8: Safety Precautions",
                "text": "Hovercraft can be dangerous, hence ensure you take all necessary safety precautions. This includes wearing protective gear such as helmets, ensuring that the hovercraft is in good condition, and adhering to local regulations."
