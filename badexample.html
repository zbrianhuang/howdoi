            <h2>Ancient Spain</h2>
            <p>Spain has a long and fascinating history that dates back to prehistoric times. The first known human settlements in Spain were established more than 35,000 years ago by the Iberians, a group of people who lived on the Iberian Peninsula. Over the centuries, Spain was occupied by various groups, including the Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans. The Romans established several cities in Spain, including Tarragona, Córdoba, and Mérida, which are still standing today.</p>

            <h2>The Medieval Period</h2>
            <p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, Spain was invaded by various groups, including the Visigoths and the Moors. In 711 AD, the Moors conquered most of Spain, establishing the Caliphate of Córdoba. The Moors brought with them advanced knowledge of science, mathematics, and medicine, which greatly influenced Spanish culture.</p>
            <p>Spain began to take shape as a united country during the Reconquista, a period of almost 800 years during which Christian kingdoms fought to reclaim the land from the Moors. In 1492, the Catholic monarchs, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, completed the Reconquista by capturing the city of Granada, ending Muslim rule in Spain.</p>

            <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
            <p>The 16th and 17th centuries are known as the Golden Age of Spain. During this time, Spain became a world power, thanks to its vast empire, which included territories in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. The Spanish Empire was built on the wealth of gold and silver from the New World, and Spain became the most powerful country in Europe.</p>
            <p>The Golden Age was also a time of great cultural achievement, with artists like Diego Velázquez, Francisco de Goya, and El Greco producing some of the most celebrated works in the history of art. Spanish literature also flourished during this time, with Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote becoming one of the most important works in the Spanish language.</p>

            <p>The 20th century was a tumultuous time for Spain. In 1936, a civil war broke out between the Republican government and the Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco. Franco emerged victorious in 1939 and established a dictatorship that lasted until his death in 1975.</p>
            <p>After Franco's death, Spain transitioned to a democracy, with King Juan Carlos I playing a key role in the transition. Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and has since become a modern, prosperous country.</p>
