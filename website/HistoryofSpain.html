        <h2>Prehistoric Spain</h2>
        <p>Spain has a rich history dating back to prehistoric times. Archaeological evidence suggests that the first humans arrived in Spain around 35,000 BC, during the Upper Paleolithic period. These early inhabitants were hunter-gatherers who relied on hunting and gathering for survival. Later, during the Neolithic period, agriculture was introduced to Spain, leading to the development of permanent settlements.</p>

        <p>In 218 BC, the Romans began their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, which would become one of their most important provinces.

        <h2>Medieval Spain</h2>
        <p>Spain in the 5th century CE was a period of significant change and turmoil. The region had been conquered by the Visigoths, a Germanic tribe, who had established a kingdom after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. The Visigothic Kingdom was marked by conflict and instability, as various factions vied for power and control.
            <br>
            During this period, the Visigoths were still in the process of establishing their rule over the region. They had successfully conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula by the mid-5th century, but they faced significant resistance from the native population. The Visigoths were largely Arian Christians, a sect that was considered heretical by the Catholic Church. This caused tension between the Visigoths and the Catholic population of Spain, which comprised the majority of the population.
            <br>
            The Visigoths also faced threats from outside the kingdom. The Byzantine Empire, which controlled much of the Mediterranean, had established a foothold in southern Spain and was attempting to expand its territory. The Visigoths fought several wars against the Byzantines during this period, which were marked by significant losses on both sides.
            <br>
            In addition to these external threats, the Visigothic Kingdom was also marked by internal conflict. The Visigoths were a tribal society, and various factions within the kingdom vied for power and influence. This led to a series of civil wars and coups, which destabilized the kingdom and made it vulnerable to external threats.
            <br>
            Despite these challenges, the Visigothic Kingdom did make some significant cultural and political achievements during this period. King Euric, who ruled from 466-484 CE, established a legal code known as the Code of Euric. This code was one of the earliest written legal systems in Europe and was influential in shaping the legal systems of later European societies.
            <br>
            The Visigoths also made significant contributions to the arts and architecture during this period. They built several impressive churches and palaces, including the Church of San Juan de Baños and the Palace of Theodoric in Ravenna, Italy.
            <br>
            In conclusion, Spain in the 5th century CE was a period of significant change and turmoil. The Visigothic Kingdom was still in the process of consolidating its rule over the region, and faced significant challenges from external and internal threats. Despite these challenges, the Visigoths made significant cultural and political achievements during this period, which had a lasting impact on the region.</p>
