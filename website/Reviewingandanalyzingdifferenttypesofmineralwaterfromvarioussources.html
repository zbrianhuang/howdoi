    <article id="Bottled vs Tap Water">
        <h2>Bottled vs Tap Water</h2>
        <p>

Water is undoubtedly one of the most essential elements required for human survival. While we can survive without food for a few days, a human body can survive only a few days without water. That's why it is essential that we pay attention to the type of water we consume. In today's world, bottled and tap water are the most commonly consumed types of water. But have you ever wondered if one is better than the other? Our article sheds some light on the differences between bottled and tap water.

Bottled Water
Bottled water is a popular choice among many consumers, primarily due to the convenience it offers. You can find bottled water in almost every grocery store, vending machine, and gas station. Besides convenience, bottled water manufacturers market their products as pure, clean, and better tasting than tap water. However, there are a few things you should be aware of before making bottled water your primary source of hydration.

First, bottled water is incredibly expensive compared to tap water. In fact, a gallon of bottled water can cost up to 2000% more than tap water. Additionally, significant amounts of plastic waste are generated from empty bottled water containers, which harms the environment. Finally, there is no guarantee that the bottled water you consume is 100% pure and free from contaminants. Several testing agencies have found traces of chemicals, bacteria, and impurities in bottled water.

Tap Water
Tap water is known to be the most cost-effective and convenient way to stay hydrated. The public water supply undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it is safe for human consumption. Most municipal water supplies in the United States are treated with contaminants such as chlorine, which effectively kills most bacteria and viruses. Also, tap water does not contribute to environmental pollution since households typically use reusable containers and do not generate plastic waste.

The major disadvantage of tap water is its taste. Some people find tap water to taste unpleasant, which can be attributed to the presence of chlorine and other chemicals used to treat it. But aside from this, tap water is considered a safe, cost-effective, and reliable source of hydration.

Conclusion
The choice between bottled and tap water comes down to personal preference. Bottled water is convenient and often marketed to be fresher and cleaner. However, it is more expensive, creates plastic waste, and may contain impurities. Tap water is cost-effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly. However, it may not taste as good and may have chemicals odor. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but it is essential to be aware of the pros and cons of both options.</p>
